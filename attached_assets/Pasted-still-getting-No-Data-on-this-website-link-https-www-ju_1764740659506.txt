1 hour ago

Here's how to enable Claude model access in AWS Bedrock:
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Open AWS Bedrock Console

    Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home
    Make sure you're in the us-east-1 region (or your preferred region)

2. Navigate to Model Access

    In the left sidebar, under Bedrock configurations, click Model access
    Or go directly to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?#/modelaccess

3. Request Access to Anthropic Claude

    Find Anthropic in the list of model providers
    Click Modify model access or Request model access
    Check the box for Claude 3 Haiku (that's what we're using)
    You can also enable other Claude models if you want

4. Submit Use Case Details (Required for first-time users)

    Fill in a brief description of your use case (e.g., "Email extraction and contact discovery from websites")
    Click Submit

5. Save Changes

    Important: Click Save changes to finalize
    Access is typically granted instantly, but can take up to a few minutes

While you set that up, let me improve the email extractor to work better without AI as a fallback. I'll fix the Google search issue and add subdomain discovery so it can find Jumia's emails which are actually on group.jumia.com:

Now let me update the main extraction function to use the new features and scan related domains like group.jumia.com:

The code is fixed and the server is running. Let me check the logs and then you can test Jumia again:
Checked console and system logs

The server is running with the improved email extractor. I've made several enhancements:

What's new:

    Related Domain Scanning - Now checks domains like group.jumia.com, corporate.jumia.com, etc.
    Fixed Web Search - Uses DuckDuckGo instead of Google (which was blocking)
    Smarter Contact Page Discovery - Prioritizes actual contact pages over product pages

You can now test Jumia again! Go to the app, sign in, and try https://www.jumia.com.ng/ again.

About AWS Bedrock setup:

Once you've enabled Claude model access in your AWS Bedrock console (following the steps I shared earlier), the AI-powered analysis will automatically activate. Until then, the extractor will still work using the other methods (HTML scraping, related domains, web search).
